# Word Cloud App using Streamlit and Python

## Description
The Word Cloud App is a web application that allows users to generate word clouds from PDF, TXT, and DOC documents. It offers customization options for word cloud generation and provides a word cloud table containing each word along with its frequency. Additionally, the app allows users to download the word cloud as an image and the word cloud table as a CSV file. This project leverages Python, the Streamlit library, and various document processing libraries to create an interactive and user-friendly word cloud generation tool.
